#This Repo 

This past weekend (October 13-15), I went to EthWaterloo, a hackathon geared towards Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum. All the "hacks" that came out of this hackathon were based on the amazing smart contracts that Ethereum provides.  

Here, I got to learn a lot about metamask, about cryptocurrencies, and about currency transfer and how blockchain isn't just about the money that's required. I got to learn an unbelievable amount of information in 36 hours. 

As a result, as one of my side projects, I will start playing around with Solidity and more smart contracts to do more good. I see a future in blockchain, and I think I'm a bit late jumping onto the train. All aboard, I can't wait for this amazing adventure!  

Oh, and this is my first official project with React too. I'm excited.

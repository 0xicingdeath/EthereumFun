# Description 

On the weekend of October 13-15th, I attended EthWaterloo, a hackathon specifically for Ethereum. All the applications that came out of this project were in some way related to blockchain, gas, ether, test networks...the like. This hackathon gave me an amazing opportunity to learn and experience the blcockhain and the technology associated with it.
